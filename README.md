# ImageClassifier
This project implements a deep learning model for classifying images as "happy" or "sad." Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow, the model is trained on a dataset containing images of people displaying varying emotions. The trained model can accurately predict whether a person in an image is happy or sad.
